# `SeqInteriorSeparators` — the seq-typed separator carrier (sub-brick `(i'-b-descend-defn)`)

This module lands the DEFINITION half of `(i'-b-descend)`: the guard conjunct that the recursive
seq-body producer threads, together with the proof that its descend/advance edges are SUBSET
restrictions (the easy half — the genuine cost is the root seed `(i'-b-descend-root)`, owed
separately).

## Why a carrier, and why it descends trivially

`ref-non-restriction-residual-root-seed` established that the two separator facts (`bodySucc`,
`noTrailingSep`) are NOT local-window-restriction facts: keyed relative to a moving origin they go
silent across `descend` (a child's depth-`0` is the parent's depth-`1`). The R297 minimal-pair probe
(`Tests/Guards/Proofs/BodySuccSeqDiscriminator.lean`) then showed the rescue: the facts hold on every
**seq-typed** depth-`0`-balanced bracket interior and fail on map-typed ones, and the discriminator
is the `btStack` TOP that `WellTyped`/`btFold` already computes — read off the pair, not invented.

So the carrier quantifies over sub-windows `[a,b) ⊆ [lo,hi)` that are **seq-typed and balanced**, and
asserts the two separator facts on each. The decisive design choice: every gate condition
(`SeqTypedInterior`) and every asserted fact (`bodySuccFact`/`noTrailingSepFact`) is keyed ONLY on
`a`, `b` and the global `tokens` — never on the outer origin `lo`/`hi`. The window bounds enter the
carrier ONLY through the domain inequalities `lo ≤ a` and `b ≤ hi`. Hence narrowing `[lo,hi)` to any
sub-interval is a pure subset restriction: the body is reused verbatim and only the domain shrinks
(`SeqInteriorSeparators_narrow`). `descend` and `advance` are two instances of exactly that.

/-- The **seq-typed bracket-interior gate** for a sub-window `[a,b)` of `tokens`, read off the same
    substrate the R297 probe used. Two window-ABSOLUTE conditions:

    * the window is depth-`0`-balanced (`flowBracketBalance tokens a b = 0`), and
    * its immediately enclosing bracket is a SEQUENCE — the head of `WellTyped`/`btFold`'s typed
      stack after consuming the strict prefix `[0, a)` is `true`
      (`flowSequenceStart ↦ true`, `flowMappingStart ↦ false`).

    Neither condition mentions an outer origin, which is exactly what makes the carrier below a
    subset restriction. -/

/-- The `bodySucc` separator fact, relativised to an arbitrary window `[a,b)` (the
    `FlowBodyContent.bodySucc`/`flowBodyContent_of_deep` premise with `lo := a`, `hi := b`): at every
    depth-`0` balanced-prefix end that is not itself a separator, the entry either closes the window
    or is immediately followed by a `.flowEntry`. -/

    k + 1 = b ∨ ∃ (_ : k + 1 < b), tokens[k + 1]!.val = .flowEntry

/-- The `noTrailingSep` fact, relativised to an arbitrary window `[a,b)` (the
    `flowBodyContent_of_deep` `h_noTrailingSep` premise with `lo := a`, `hi := b`): the window cannot
    END on a depth-`0` separator — a `.flowEntry` at the last position would have to be followed by
    flow content, which an end-of-window cannot supply. -/

/-- **The separator carrier.** Over the window `[lo,hi)`: for every seq-typed depth-`0`-balanced
    bracket-interior sub-window `[a,b) ⊆ [lo,hi)`, both separator facts hold on `[a,b)`.

    This is the guard conjunct the recursive seq-body producer threads. Its body is `lo`/`hi`-free
    except through the domain bounds `lo ≤ a`, `b ≤ hi`, so it restricts to sub-windows for free. -/

/-- **Subset restriction (the descend/advance edge, generic form).** Narrowing the window to any
    sub-interval `[lo',hi') ⊆ [lo,hi)` preserves the carrier: the quantifier body is reused verbatim,
    only the domain shrinks. This is the 3-line `omega`-style core the 145th-revision map promised. -/

/-- **Both separator facts from a windowed `SafeBodyUnit`** — the per-window discharge the root seed
    `(i'-b-descend-root)` consumes at every reached seq level.  The seq body producer delivers, over
    each seq-typed body window `[a,b)`, a `SafeBodyUnit ContentStartTok ((tokens.toList.take b).drop a)`
    (directly from emission — `emitList_body_filtered_characterization` / `RecSeqBody.toSafeBodyUnit`,
    NOT circular through the not-yet-built recursion output).  This single substrate yields BOTH of the
    carrier's asserted facts:

    * `bodySuccFact` — values are comma-separated — via `SafeBodyUnit_array_succ_window` (value-end
      successor, the panic-indexing bridge identical to `seqBodyProps_of_windowed_safebody`'s
      `h_body_succ` branch);
    * `noTrailingSepFact` — no trailing comma — via `SafeBodyUnit_array_last_not_sep_window`
      *vacuously*: it refutes a depth-`0` `.flowEntry` at the window's last position, so the premise is
      contradictory and `isFlowContentStart` follows by `absurd`.

    So the carrier's body is dischargeable from the producer's OWN deliverable: the root seed need only
    establish `SafeBodyUnit` at each seq level, with no separate Part 7 producing lemma. -/

    `≥ 1` interior condition is stated for *proper nonempty* prefixes (`0 < i`), so it already gives
    `EntrySafe`'s `.flowEntry`-at-balance-`≥ 1` obligation at every `i > 0`; only the `i = 0` head case
    is open.  A `Q`-head with `hQ : Q v → v ≠ .flowEntry` closes it: the head cannot BE a `.flowEntry`,
    so the `i = 0` obligation is vacuous.  (Without the head hypothesis a lone-`.flowEntry` IS an
    `EntryUnit` but not an `EntrySafe`, so `hQ` is genuinely needed.) -/

/-- **`SafeBodyUnit Q → SafeBody Q`** (given `hQ : ∀ v, Q v → v ≠ .flowEntry`).  Both inductives share
    their shape (nonempty `Q`-headed entries separated by single `.flowEntry`s); they differ only in the
    per-entry refinement (`EntryUnit` vs `EntrySafe`), and `EntryUnit_entrySafe` bridges that for each
    `Q`-headed entry.  So a windowed `SafeBodyUnit ContentStartTok` body — the single substrate the
    enclosing-facts provider keys on — also satisfies the WEAKER `SafeBody`, unlocking the existing
    `SafeBody_array_flowEntry_window` (post-separator content-start) wrapper for the `feContentStart`
    fact below WITHOUT a second producer deliverable.  (The producer's `RecSeqBody` projects to both via
    `RecSeqBody.toSafeBody`/`.toSafeBodyUnit`; this coercion lets the consume side stay keyed on ONE
    `SafeBodyUnit`, per `ref-fold-consumer-chain-to-producer-contract`.) -/

/-- **The interior `feContentStart` fact from a windowed `SafeBodyUnit`** — the ONE new sub-fact of the
    enclosing bundle `(i'-b-encfacts)` (`bodySuccFact`/`noTrailingSepFact` were already done by
    `seqSeparatorFacts_of_windowed_safebodyunit`).  At every INTERIOR depth-`0` separator `k` of the
    window `[a,b)` (`a ≤ k`, `k+1 < b`, `tokens[k]! = .flowEntry`, `flowBracketBalance tokens a k = 0`),
    the successor token is flow-content-start.  This is the comma→content alternation of a seq body: a
    depth-`0` `.flowEntry` is a separator BETWEEN units, and the unit that follows starts with a
    `ContentStartTok` head.

    The proof coerces the `SafeBodyUnit` to a `SafeBody` (`SafeBodyUnit_safeBody`) and applies the
    existing post-separator wrapper `SafeBody_array_flowEntry_window`, whose `Q`-successor conclusion is
    `ContentStartTok (tokens[k+1]).val` — definitionally `isFlowContentStart (tokens[k+1]).val`.  The
    only glue is the `getElem!`↔`getElem` panic-index bridge.  De-risked on `[[1, 2], 9]`: at the
    enclosing seqs `[3,6)`/`[2,9)` the interior commas at `4`/`7` are followed by content at `5`/`8`. -/

/-- **The THREE-fact enclosing bundle from ONE windowed `SafeBodyUnit`** — the per-window deliverable
    `(i'-b-encfacts)` that the `provider` of `seqInteriorSeparators_of_enclosing_provider` must supply
    at each located enclosing seq `[loS,hiS)`.  A single windowed
    `SafeBodyUnit ContentStartTok ((tokens.toList.take b).drop a)` — which the seq-body producer delivers
    at every genuine seq body (`RecSeqBody.toSafeBodyUnit`, no recursion through the not-yet-built
    output) — yields ALL THREE facts the two rebases consume:

    * `bodySuccFact tokens a b` (`bodySuccFact_rebase`'s source) and
    * `noTrailingSepFact tokens a b` (`noTrailingSepFact_rebase`'s no-trailing source) — both from
      `seqSeparatorFacts_of_windowed_safebodyunit`;
    * the interior depth-`0` `feContentStart` (`noTrailingSepFact_rebase`'s `h_enc_fe` source) — from
      `seqInteriorFeContentStart_of_windowed_safebodyunit`.

    So the provider's deliverable at a located enclosing seq is *exactly* a windowed `SafeBodyUnit`;
    `(i'-b-encfacts)` is closed and the residual narrows to `(i'-b-locator)` — recover the enclosing
    `.flowSequenceStart`/matching-close and its windowed `SafeBodyUnit` (the `btFold`-top → opener
    converse of `enclosingMark_true_of_opener`, reusing `recseqentry_seqbracket_oracle`). -/

/-- **The ROOT instance of the enclosing-facts `provider`** — `(i'-b-locator)` base case, per
    [[ref-universal-producer-root-seed-first]].  At the outermost seq `[2, size-2)` of a concrete
    flow-sequence output `"[" ++ emitList items ++ "]"`, `seqRoot_safeBodyUnit` delivers the windowed
    `SafeBodyUnit` *directly from emission*, with NO recursion through nested seq windows.  Feeding it
    through `seqEnclosingFacts_of_windowed_safebodyunit` gives the three enclosing facts at
    `loS = 2`, `hiS = size - 2`, so for any gated sub-window `[a,b)` whose enclosing seq IS the outer
    one — characterised by the **top-level discriminator** `flowBracketBalance tokens 2 a = 0`
    (the window starts at the outer seq's depth, not nested deeper) — the provider's existential is
    satisfied by `⟨2, size-2, …⟩`.

    This pins `provider` at the root: the bounds `2 ≤ a`, `b ≤ size-2` and the discriminator are
    exactly `loS ≤ a`, `b ≤ hiS`, `flowBracketBalance tokens loS a = 0`, passed through; the three
    enclosing facts come from the outer-seq `SafeBodyUnit`.  The `loS - 1 = 1` opener is the outer
    `[` — no `recseqentry_seqbracket_oracle` descent is consulted (the descent supplies the SAME
    existential at nested levels, the inductive step owed separately).  The discriminator
    `flowBracketBalance tokens 2 a = 0` is what the locator's descent establishes for root-level
    windows (the gate `SeqTypedInterior` alone admits deeper-nested windows too, so it cannot be
    derived here — it is the root case's hypothesis). -/

/-- **The gate's stack-top conjunct is RECONSTRUCTIBLE in place** — the Q2 discharge for
    `(i'-b-descend-root)`.  `SeqTypedInterior`'s second conjunct
    (`(btFold (some []) (tokens.toList.take a)).bind (·.head?) = some true`) is a fact about the
    PREFIX `[0,a)`, NOT about the window interior `[a,b)` — so it is NOT a projection of
    `FlowBodyWindow` (whose `wellTyped` field only sees the interior).  But it reconstructs from two
    boundary facts the recursion already supplies at every seq window:

    * the **opener** just before the body is a `.flowSequenceStart` (`tokens[q]` with `q = a - 1` —
      the seq oracle's `h_open : tokens[lo]!.val = .flowSequenceStart`, and the root window's outer `[`);
    * the **pre-opener prefix folds to some typed stack** `s` (from the global `WellTyped` of the
      concrete output via `WellTyped_prefix_some` — `btFold` of any prefix of a `WellTyped` list is
      `some`).

    A `.flowSequenceStart` pushes `true` (`btStep … = some (true :: s)`), so the stack top after the
    opener is `true`.  This is a [[ref-reconstruct-in-place-over-relocate]] discharge: the gate is
    reconstructed AT the window from its own boundary, not threaded as a second universal — and the
    two hypotheses below ARE the precise facts the root seed must thread per seq window. -/

/-- **The consumer fold — `SeqInteriorSeparators` reduces to a `SafeBodyUnit` provider** (the first
    landable brick of `(i'-b-descend-root)`, per `ref-universal-producer-root-seed-first` /
    `ref-fold-consumer-chain-to-producer-contract`).

    The carrier's body is, at every gated sub-window `[a,b)`, exactly the per-window discharge
    `seqSeparatorFacts_of_windowed_safebodyunit` (R299): one windowed
    `SafeBodyUnit ContentStartTok ((tokens.toList.take b).drop a)` yields BOTH separator facts. So
    proving the carrier `∀`-statement amounts to providing that `SafeBodyUnit` at every gated
    sub-window — and nothing else. This lemma folds the whole consumer chain
    (gate → windowed `SafeBodyUnit` → both facts) into ONE step whose sole hypothesis, `provider`, IS
    the producer's remaining contract: *deliver `SafeBodyUnit` at each seq-typed depth-`0`-balanced
    sub-window of `[lo,hi)`*.

    This retypes the residual from "establish the carrier" to "establish the `SafeBodyUnit`
    provider" (`ref-reduction-by-import`: the retype is the progress). What remains for
    `(i'-b-descend-root)` is exactly `provider`:

    * the **root instance** — `provider` at the outer seq window `[2, size-2)`, where emission
      (`emitList_scans_safebody` / `emitList_body_filtered_characterization`) delivers the outer
      `SafeBodyUnit` directly, no recursion (`ref-universal-producer-root-seed-first` base case);
    * the **descent** — `provider` at each nested seq level, the `btFold`/width-driven induction.

    The gate `SeqTypedInterior tokens a b` is the provider's hypothesis (it picks out exactly the
    seq-typed windows that ARE emitted seq bodies; the R297 probe confirmed `bodySucc` holds on these
    and fails on map-typed interiors, which the gate excludes). -/

/-- **A `SafeBodyUnit`'s head satisfies `Q`** — the necessary precondition the `provider` deliverable
    carries that `SeqTypedInterior` does NOT supply.  In both constructors the first entry `e` is
    nonempty with a `Q`-satisfying head (`h_head : Q (e.head …).val`), and the body's head IS that
    entry's head (`e ≠ []` ⇒ `(e ++ _).head = e.head`).  So any body that is a `SafeBodyUnit Q` starts
    with a `Q`-token. -/

/-- **A separator-headed window is NOT a `ContentStartTok` `SafeBodyUnit`** — the kernel of the
    de-risk that re-scopes `(i'-b-descend-root-provider-descent)`.  `ContentStartTok` excludes
    `.flowEntry` (`ContentStartTok_ne_flowEntry`), and a `SafeBodyUnit` forces a `ContentStartTok` head
    (`SafeBodyUnit_head_Q`); so a window whose first token is a `.flowEntry` cannot be a
    `SafeBodyUnit ContentStartTok`.

    **Why this matters for the `provider`.** The gate `SeqTypedInterior tokens a b`
    (`flowBracketBalance tokens a b = 0` ∧ enclosing-seq `btFold`-top `= some true`) places NO
    constraint on the window's head token, so it ADMITS separator-headed windows.  A `#guard`-backed
    minimal pair on the real filtered scan of `[[1, 2], 9]` (filtered tokens
    `streamStart [ [ "1" , "2" ] , "9" ] streamEnd`) confirms it: the two depth-`0` commas at indices
    `4` and `7` BOTH satisfy the gate at `[a, a+1)` (`balance = 0`, `btFold`-top `= some true`,
    enclosed by the outer seq), yet each window's slice is `[comma]`, refuted here.  Hence the
    `provider` hypothesis of `seqInteriorSeparators_of_safebody_provider` is **undischargeable at the
    spurious gated windows** the carrier's `∀ a b` ranges over.  (Content-start-alignment is necessary
    but NOT sufficient either: the gated, content-start-headed window `[3, 5)` = `"1" ,` is a
    trailing-separator slice that is also not a `SafeBodyUnit`.)  The carrier's asserted facts
    (`bodySuccFact`/`noTrailingSepFact`) remain TRUE at every gated window — they reference the
    boundary token past the slice — so the fix is to discharge the carrier's facts directly at the
    windows the future seq-producer actually instantiates (real seq-body interiors `[opener+1, close)`
    and their comma-suffix advance-tails, all genuine `SafeBodyUnit`s), NOT via a uniform per-gated-
    window `SafeBodyUnit` provider.  See Reflection 303. -/

/-- **`bodySuccFact` RE-BASING** — the first brick of the R303 direct-discharge route, replacing the
    undischargeable per-window `SafeBodyUnit` provider.  Given the *enclosing* seq interior's
    `bodySuccFact` over `[loS, hiS)` (its comma-separation, which the seq body producer / `RecSeqBody`
    delivers at the seq level), the SAME fact holds on any sub-window `[a, b) ⊆ [loS, hiS)` whose start
    `a` sits at the enclosing seq's TOP level — i.e. `flowBracketBalance tokens loS a = 0`.  No
    `SafeBodyUnit`, no per-window deliverable: the proof is pure balance composition.

    **Why this is the redirect.** R303 showed the per-gated-window `SafeBodyUnit` route is FALSE (a
    separator-headed gated window is no `SafeBodyUnit`), yet a `#guard`-backed probe on `[[1, 2], 9]`
    and on `[{a: 1}, 2]` confirmed `bodySuccFact` holds at EVERY gated window — including those spurious
    separator-headed ones — because the fact references the boundary token past the slice, not the
    slice's body-ness.  This lemma is the mechanism: at a window start `a` re-based to depth `0` of the
    enclosing seq, `balance loS (k+1) = balance loS a + balance a (k+1) = 0 + 0` for every interior end
    `k`, so the enclosing `bodySuccFact` fires verbatim, and its window-close disjunct `k+1 = hiS`
    collapses to `k+1 = b` exactly because `k < b ≤ hiS` pins `b = k+1` there.  The enclosing-seq gate
    (`SeqTypedInterior`'s `btFold`-top `= some true`) is what guarantees `a` is at a SEQ top level (not a
    mapping interior, where `bodySuccFact` is FALSE — a key is followed by `.value`, not a separator):
    the probe shows every `bodySuccFact`-failing window is non-gated.  Names no deliverable type, so it
    serves both axes; this is [[ref-window-absolute-gate-subset-restriction]] with the source fact (the
    enclosing seq's `bodySuccFact`) re-based across the depth-`0` re-seating rather than a local guard
    conjunct narrowed. -/

/-- **`noTrailingSepFact` RE-BASING** — the twin of `bodySuccFact_rebase` for the carrier's second
    fact.  On a sub-window `[a, b) ⊆ [loS, hiS)` re-based to the enclosing seq's top level
    (`flowBracketBalance tokens loS a = 0`), the no-trailing-separator fact follows from the enclosing
    seq interior's OWN facts: the only relevant position is the window's last `k = b - 1`, a depth-`0`
    (re-based) `.flowEntry`, and the token AFTER it (`tokens[b]`) must be content-start.  Two cases on
    where `b` sits relative to the enclosing close `hiS`:

    * `b < hiS` — `b - 1` is an INTERIOR depth-`0` separator of the enclosing seq, so the enclosing
      depth-`0` `feContentStart` (`h_enc_fe`, the `FlowBodyContent.feContentStart` field) gives the
      following content-start directly;
    * `b = hiS` — `b - 1 = hiS - 1` is the enclosing seq's LAST position, so the enclosing
      `noTrailingSepFact` (`h_enc_nts`) supplies it.

    Both branches re-base the depth premise by composition (`balance loS (b-1) = balance loS a +
    balance a (b-1) = 0`).  Pure case-split + composition, no `SafeBodyUnit`.  Together with
    `bodySuccFact_rebase` this discharges the full carrier body at a re-based seq-top-level window from
    the enclosing seq interior's facts — the R303 redirect, complete for the consume side. -/

/-- **The carrier ASSEMBLES from a per-window enclosing-facts `provider`** (the second brick of the
    R303 direct-discharge route, `(i'-b-locate-enclosing)` — the [[ref-parametric-assembler-extraction]]
    split of the locate boundary).  `bodySuccFact_rebase`/`noTrailingSepFact_rebase` are pure balance
    composition, so the carrier `SeqInteriorSeparators tokens lo hi` reduces — with NO further analysis —
    to a `provider` that, at every gated sub-window `[a,b)`, hands back the *enclosing* seq interior
    `[loS,hiS)` together with the three rebase preconditions/facts:

    * the bounds + re-seating `loS ≤ a`, `b ≤ hiS`, `flowBracketBalance tokens loS a = 0` (the window
      starts at the enclosing seq's TOP level — exactly what the gate's `btFold`-top `= some true`
      witnesses, converse of `enclosingMark_true_of_opener`);
    * the enclosing seq's `bodySuccFact tokens loS hiS` (its comma-separation) — `bodySuccFact_rebase`'s
      source fact;
    * the enclosing seq's interior `feContentStart` (every interior depth-`0` separator is followed by
      content) and its `noTrailingSepFact tokens loS hiS` — `noTrailingSepFact_rebase`'s two sources.

    This is the parametric-assembler-extraction move: lift the inline locate-the-enclosing-window
    reasoning into a `∀ window, gate → ∃ enclosing, …` hypothesis and discharge the *assemble* now (one
    `obtain` + two rebases), splitting the residual into ASSEMBLE (done, here) vs PRODUCE the `provider`
    (the locator — [[ref-reduction-by-import]]).

    **De-risk (`#guard`-backed, on the R304 witness `[[1, 2], 9]`).** A probe enumerating all 12 gated
    windows confirmed that EACH has a located enclosing seq body satisfying every clause above:
    `[3,5)`/`[4,6)`/… → the inner seq `[3,6)`; `[7,9)`/`[8,9)`/… → the outer seq `[2,9)`; the
    preconditions and all enclosing facts evaluate `true` at every one, and the rebase reproduces the
    window's own `bodySuccFact`/`noTrailingSepFact`.  So the `provider` hypothesis is satisfiable — the
    residual is genuine and the assembler is not vacuous.

    **The named residual — `provider`.** Producing it is the locator: from the gate's `btFold`-top
    `= some true` at `a`, recover the innermost enclosing `.flowSequenceStart` at `loS - 1` and its
    matching close `hiS` (the existing `recseqentry_seqbracket_oracle` / `FlowBodyWindow` machinery),
    then supply the enclosing facts from that seq's `SafeBodyUnit`/`RecSeqBody`
    (`seqSeparatorFacts_of_windowed_safebodyunit` for `bodySuccFact`/`noTrailingSepFact`; the interior
    `feContentStart` is the one new sub-fact, the comma-followed-by-content of `RecSeqBody`).  The
    `SafeBodyUnit` route — FALSE for arbitrary gated windows (R303) — is VALID here because `[loS,hiS)`
    is a GENUINE seq body, the right granularity ([[ref-near-leaf-mirror-sheds-machinery]]). -/
