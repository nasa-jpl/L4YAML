# `SeqInteriorSeparators` — the seq-typed separator carrier (sub-brick `(i'-b-descend-defn)`)

This module lands the DEFINITION half of `(i'-b-descend)`: the guard conjunct that the recursive
seq-body producer threads, together with the proof that its descend/advance edges are SUBSET
restrictions (the easy half — the genuine cost is the root seed `(i'-b-descend-root)`, owed
separately).

## Why a carrier, and why it descends trivially

`ref-non-restriction-residual-root-seed` established that the two separator facts (`bodySucc`,
`noTrailingSep`) are NOT local-window-restriction facts: keyed relative to a moving origin they go
silent across `descend` (a child's depth-`0` is the parent's depth-`1`). The R297 minimal-pair probe
(`Tests/Guards/Proofs/BodySuccSeqDiscriminator.lean`) then showed the rescue: the facts hold on every
**seq-typed** depth-`0`-balanced bracket interior and fail on map-typed ones, and the discriminator
is the `btStack` TOP that `WellTyped`/`btFold` already computes — read off the pair, not invented.

So the carrier quantifies over sub-windows `[a,b) ⊆ [lo,hi)` that are **seq-typed and balanced**, and
asserts the two separator facts on each. The decisive design choice: every gate condition
(`SeqTypedInterior`) and every asserted fact (`bodySuccFact`/`noTrailingSepFact`) is keyed ONLY on
`a`, `b` and the global `tokens` — never on the outer origin `lo`/`hi`. The window bounds enter the
carrier ONLY through the domain inequalities `lo ≤ a` and `b ≤ hi`. Hence narrowing `[lo,hi)` to any
sub-interval is a pure subset restriction: the body is reused verbatim and only the domain shrinks
(`SeqInteriorSeparators_narrow`). `descend` and `advance` are two instances of exactly that.

/-- The **seq-typed bracket-interior gate** for a sub-window `[a,b)` of `tokens`, read off the same
    substrate the R297 probe used. Two window-ABSOLUTE conditions:

    * the window is depth-`0`-balanced (`flowBracketBalance tokens a b = 0`), and
    * its immediately enclosing bracket is a SEQUENCE — the head of `WellTyped`/`btFold`'s typed
      stack after consuming the strict prefix `[0, a)` is `true`
      (`flowSequenceStart ↦ true`, `flowMappingStart ↦ false`).

    Neither condition mentions an outer origin, which is exactly what makes the carrier below a
    subset restriction. -/

  flowBracketBalance tokens a b = 0 ∧
  (btFold (some []) (tokens.toList.take a)).bind (·.head?) = some true

/-- The `bodySucc` separator fact, relativised to an arbitrary window `[a,b)` (the
    `FlowBodyContent.bodySucc`/`flowBodyContent_of_deep` premise with `lo := a`, `hi := b`): at every
    depth-`0` balanced-prefix end that is not itself a separator, the entry either closes the window
    or is immediately followed by a `.flowEntry`. -/
def bodySuccFact (tokens : Array (Positioned YamlToken)) (a b : Nat) : Prop :=
  ∀ k, a ≤ k → k < b →
    flowBracketBalance tokens a (k + 1) = 0 →
    tokens[k]!.val ≠ .flowEntry →
    k + 1 = b ∨ ∃ (_ : k + 1 < b), tokens[k + 1]!.val = .flowEntry

/-- The `noTrailingSep` fact, relativised to an arbitrary window `[a,b)` (the
    `flowBodyContent_of_deep` `h_noTrailingSep` premise with `lo := a`, `hi := b`): the window cannot
    END on a depth-`0` separator — a `.flowEntry` at the last position would have to be followed by
    flow content, which an end-of-window cannot supply. -/
def noTrailingSepFact (tokens : Array (Positioned YamlToken)) (a b : Nat) : Prop :=
  ∀ k, a ≤ k → k + 1 = b →
    tokens[k]!.val = .flowEntry →
    flowBracketBalance tokens a k = 0 →
    isFlowContentStart tokens[k + 1]!.val

/-- **The separator carrier.** Over the window `[lo,hi)`: for every seq-typed depth-`0`-balanced
    bracket-interior sub-window `[a,b) ⊆ [lo,hi)`, both separator facts hold on `[a,b)`.

    This is the guard conjunct the recursive seq-body producer threads. Its body is `lo`/`hi`-free
    except through the domain bounds `lo ≤ a`, `b ≤ hi`, so it restricts to sub-windows for free. -/
def SeqInteriorSeparators (tokens : Array (Positioned YamlToken)) (lo hi : Nat) : Prop :=
  ∀ a b, lo ≤ a → a ≤ b → b ≤ hi → SeqTypedInterior tokens a b →

/-- **Subset restriction (the descend/advance edge, generic form).** Narrowing the window to any
    sub-interval `[lo',hi') ⊆ [lo,hi)` preserves the carrier: the quantifier body is reused verbatim,
    only the domain shrinks. This is the 3-line `omega`-style core the 145th-revision map promised. -/

    `[lo',hi') ⊆ [lo,hi)`, the carrier follows by subset restriction. -/

  SeqInteriorSeparators_narrow h_lo h_hi h

/-- **The ADVANCE edge.** When the recursion advances past a separator at `m` to the tail
    `[m+1, hi)`, the carrier follows by subset restriction (`hi` unchanged). -/

/-- `ContentStartTok` (the head predicate of a seq body's unit entries) never holds of a `.flowEntry`:
    it is a scalar / `[` / `{`, never the separator `,`.  This is the `hQ` the no-trailing-comma
    substrate lemma needs to refute a lone-separator unit. -/
theorem ContentStartTok_ne_flowEntry : ∀ v, ContentStartTok v → v ≠ .flowEntry := by
  rintro v (⟨c, st, rfl⟩ | rfl | rfl) <;> simp

/-- **Both separator facts from a windowed `SafeBodyUnit`** — the per-window discharge the root seed
    `(i'-b-descend-root)` consumes at every reached seq level.  The seq body producer delivers, over
    each seq-typed body window `[a,b)`, a `SafeBodyUnit ContentStartTok ((tokens.toList.take b).drop a)`
    (directly from emission — `emitList_body_filtered_characterization` / `RecSeqBody.toSafeBodyUnit`,
    NOT circular through the not-yet-built recursion output).  This single substrate yields BOTH of the
    carrier's asserted facts:

    * `bodySuccFact` — values are comma-separated — via `SafeBodyUnit_array_succ_window` (value-end
      successor, the panic-indexing bridge identical to `seqBodyProps_of_windowed_safebody`'s
      `h_body_succ` branch);
    * `noTrailingSepFact` — no trailing comma — via `SafeBodyUnit_array_last_not_sep_window`
      *vacuously*: it refutes a depth-`0` `.flowEntry` at the window's last position, so the premise is
      contradictory and `isFlowContentStart` follows by `absurd`.

    So the carrier's body is dischargeable from the producer's OWN deliverable: the root seed need only
    establish `SafeBodyUnit` at each seq level, with no separate Part 7 producing lemma. -/
