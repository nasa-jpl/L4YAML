# The column law is false, and one arm refutes it (DOCS item 234)

Item 233 measured why nothing in the library refutes a `SepResidue`: the fact
that would refute one is a statement about a LINE, and neither `SurfPos` nor
`ScannerSurfCorr` carries a line.  A column is the only coordinate a surface
position has besides its characters, so the coordinate a refuter needs has to
be built out of column arithmetic, and item 233 named the law it would rest on:

> a column advances by the characters consumed, except across a break —
> `s'.col = s.col + |span s s'|` or `BreakBetween s s'`.

**That law is false.**  §1 refutes it against a derivation of a real
production, and §2 finds the single arm responsible out of 167.

## What the arm is, and why it is not a bug

`[202] l-document-prefix` consumes a byte-order mark and does NOT advance the
column, on purpose: the module docstring in `Surface/Document.lean` records
that carrying `col + 1` put the first line one column deeper than every other,
so that `﻿a: 1⏎b: 2` dedented below its own `[187] l+block-mapping` and `﻿---`
sat off column 0 where `[203] c-directives-end` cannot be read.  The BOM is a
character that occupies no column.  So the law is not repairable by fixing the
grammar; it is the law that is wrong.

## The corrected statement

    s'.col + (BOMs consumed) = s.col + |span s s'|   ∨   BreakBetween s s'

— a column advances by the characters consumed that are not byte-order marks,
except across a break.

## What survives for a refuter, and it is the half that matters

A consumer refutes `BreakBetween` from the OTHER direction:

    BreakBetween s s' → s'.col < |span s s'|

whose contrapositive — a column at least as large as the span means no break —
is the fact `[193] c-s-implicit-json-key` needs.  The BOM does not touch it: it
eats a character without a break, which only makes the span longer.  What that
induction needs at its leaves is exactly what §2 pins: **every arm that writes
column 0 eats a literal line break** (`reset=3`, all three `SBBreak`), and **no
arm advances the column over a line break** — 25 arms eat only literals and
none is a break, and the 11 that eat a variable character do so under a
predicate §3 shows admits neither `'\n'` nor `'\r'`.

The one arm that could advance over a break is `GConsumeAll.cons`, which eats
any character at all.  §4 shows nothing instantiates it.

## Reading the instrument

Two readings cost this census its first two answers, and both are recorded in
the code below.  The pretty-printer renders `'\r'` as `'\x0d'`, so a census
that compared rendered strings called `SBBreak.cr` a violation; and
`Expr.nat?` does not read a raw literal, which is what a `Char` literal
carries.  The third was structural: `forallTelescope` hands back the
CONCLUSION, and `SLDocumentPrefix.bom` relates its two positions in a PREMISE,
so a census that walked conclusions alone reported zero violations — the
well-behaved arms are precisely the ones whose evidence is in the conclusion.
