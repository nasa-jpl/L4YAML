# The dead-declaration census — the pins (DOCS items 476 / 477)

`lake run dead-census -- --check` (`Scripts/Main/DeadCensus.lean`, classifier
`Scripts/Dead/Census.lean`) recomputes, off the built environment of `L4YAML` + `Tests.Guards` +
`Tests.AdversarialInstantiation` + `Tests.Reflections`, every user-named library declaration no
`@[capstone]` / `@[export]` root reaches, splits it into (A) campaign in progress, (C) API by
convention, (D) Rule 2 / instrument-only and (B) the roster, and compares two pins:

* `expectedDeadCensus` — the one-line summary (counts); `--write` rewrites it.
* `expectedDeadRoster` (`DeadDeclarationRoster.lean`) — class (B) as a SET of fully-qualified
  names, shrink-only: a name entering it is a declaration reached by nothing — Rule 1's finding;
  a name leaving it was deleted or reached by a capstone.

The guard below ties the two: the roster's line count is the `B-roster=` the summary names, so
neither can be edited without the other.
