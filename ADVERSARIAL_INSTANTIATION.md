# Adversarial Instantiation — Application to L4YAML

Application of the [Adversarial Instantiation methodology](../../.claude/ADVERSARIAL_INSTANTIATION.md)
to the lean4-yaml-verified.iterators project (v0.4.7).

## Triage: When to Audit vs. When to Prove Directly

Not every sorry'd theorem warrants adversarial instantiation. The decision is a 2×2 matrix
of **statement risk** (could the theorem be false?) and **proof cost** (how hard to prove?):

```
                        Proof Cost
                    LOW              HIGH
                ┌────────────┬─────────────────┐
Statement  LOW  │  PROVE     │  PROVE          │
Risk            │  directly  │ (audit optional)│
                ├────────────┼─────────────────┤
           HIGH │  AUDIT     │  AUDIT          │
                │  then      │  first, then    │
                │  PROVE     │  PROVE          │
                └────────────┴─────────────────┘
```

High statement risk + low proof cost → audit is cheap insurance, do both.
Low statement risk + high proof cost → proof effort is the bottleneck, skip audit.
High statement risk + high proof cost → **audit is critical** — don't invest weeks in
proving a false statement.

### Statement Risk Indicators (fast to assess: ~30 seconds each)

| Indicator | Risk level | How to check |
|-----------|-----------|--------------|
| `∀` over positions/indices in arrays | **HIGH** | Scan for `∀ k, lo ≤ k → k < hi → P tokens[k]` |
| `∀` over scanner/parser states | **HIGH** | Universal over `ScannerState` or `ParseState` |
| Postcondition strengthened recently | **HIGH** | Was a field added to the predicate without a matching hypothesis? |
| Existential in conclusion | **MEDIUM** | `∃ s', f s = ok s' ∧ P s'` — the existence claim itself could fail |
| Pure arithmetic on list/array folds | **LOW** | `fbb(lo,hi) = fbb(lo,mid) + fbb(mid,hi)` — correct by construction |
| Single-function unfold | **LOW** | `scanBlockEntry s = ok s' → P s'` — one function, no composition |

### Proof Cost Indicators (fast to assess: ~30 seconds each)

| Indicator | Cost level | How to check |
|-----------|-----------|--------------|
| Estimated ≤ 25 LOC | **LOW** | See Est. LOC in sorry inventory |
| No loops in the function | **LOW** | Direct unfold + field access |
| Single dispatch branch | **LOW** | One function, no case explosion |
| Requires loop invariant | **HIGH** | `skipToContent`, `unwindIndents`, scalar loops |
| Requires recursive/inductive reasoning | **HIGH** | Nested collections, fuel sufficiency |
| Depends on 2+ sorry'd lemmas | **HIGH** | Blocked until dependencies are cleared |

### Decision rule

1. Check statement risk indicators (~30 sec). If ≥ 1 HIGH indicator → **AUDIT**.
2. If no HIGH risk indicators, check proof cost. If LOW → **PROVE directly** (skip audit).
3. If HIGH proof cost + MEDIUM risk → **AUDIT** (cheap insurance before expensive proof).
4. If LOW proof cost + HIGH risk → **AUDIT then PROVE** (audit catches bugs fast, proof is easy).

**Time budget**: Adversarial instantiation should take ≤ 30 minutes per theorem (writing
`#eval`/`#guard` checks). If it takes longer, the theorem's predicates may not be
computationally tractable for testing — fall back to careful manual review of the
statement.

## Current Sorry Inventory: Triage Results (21 sorrys)

### Category 1: PROVE directly (11 theorems, ~$250 LOC)

These are low-risk, low-to-medium cost. Skip adversarial instantiation.

| # | Theorem | Why PROVE | Est. LOC |
|---|---------|-----------|----------|
| 9i | `flowBracketBalance_compose` | Pure list fold arithmetic. Partition foldl. | 15–25 |
| 9j | `flowBracketBalance_push` | Pure array push doesn't affect prior slice. | 15–25 |
| 9k | `parseFlowSequenceLoop_emitter_ok` h_bal (×2) | Direct corollary of `_compose`. `rw; ring`. | 10–20 |
| 9l | `parseFlowMappingLoop_emitter_ok` h_bal (×2) | Same pattern. | 10–20 |
| — | `scanBlockEntry_filtered_grows` | Single function, one `emit .blockEntry`. | 15–25 |
| — | `scanKey_filtered_grows` | Single function, one `emit .key`. | 15–25 |
| — | `scanValue_filtered_grows` | Single function + `setIfInBounds`. | 20–30 |
| — | `dispatchContent_filtered_grows` | Dispatch + per-function composition. | 30–50 |
| — | `scanNextToken_filtered_grows` (structural case) | `scanDirective` branch; vacuous for emitter output. | 10–20 |
| — | `dispatchFlowIndicators_preserves_bound` | One branch (flowEntry), injection + field access. | 10–20 |
| — | `scanValue_BoundInv` | No loops, field updates + advance. | 40–80 |

#### Category 1 accomplishments

All 11 Category 1 theorems have been addressed:

| # | Theorem | Status | Notes |
|---|---------|--------|-------|
| 9i | `flowBracketBalance_compose` | **PROVEN** | List fold partition via `List.take_append_drop` |
| 9j | `flowBracketBalance_push` | **PROVEN** | Array push doesn't affect prior slice |
| 9k | `parseFlowSequenceLoop_emitter_ok` h_bal (×2) | **PROVEN** | Corollary of `_compose` |
| 9l | `parseFlowMappingLoop_emitter_ok` h_bal (×2) | **PROVEN** | Same pattern |
| — | `scanBlockEntry_filtered_grows` | **PROVEN** | `filtered_grows_of_any_new` + `emit_tokens_push` |
| — | `scanKey_filtered_grows` | **PROVEN** | Same pattern |
| — | `scanValue_filtered_grows` | **PROVEN** | Complex: `setIfInBounds` + `Array_setIfInBounds_filter_mono` |
| — | `dispatchContent_filtered_grows` | **PROVEN** | Used helper `dispatchContent_new_not_placeholder` |
| — | `scanNextToken_filtered_grows` (directive case) | **→ Cat 2** | Reclassified: unknown directives emit 0 tokens |
| — | `dispatchFlowIndicators_preserves_bound` | **PROVEN** | Injection + field access |
| — | `scanValue_BoundInv` | **PROVEN** | No loops, field updates + advance |

10 of 11 proven. 1 reclassified to Category 2 (the directive case in `scanNextToken_filtered_grows`
requires knowing that emitter-produced inputs don't contain unknown `%RESERVED` directives).

#### Category 1 reflections

**What worked:**
- The `filtered_grows_of_any_new` lemma pattern was highly reusable across all `*_filtered_grows` proofs.
- Per-scanner `_adds_one_token` and `_preserves_prefix` lemmas from ScannerCorrectness.lean composed cleanly.
- `Array_setIfInBounds_filter_mono` handled the `scanValue` case where a `.placeholder` token is overwritten.

**What didn't:**
- `simp only [Except.ok.injEq] at h` inside `<;>` blocks can fail when `h` has already been simplified in a prior step. The `<;>` combinator applies to post-split goals where `h` may no longer contain `Except.ok`.
- `simp only [bind, Except.bind]` vs `simp only [Bind.bind, Except.bind]` — both work in isolation but can fail inside large proofs where the hypothesis has already been modified by earlier simp steps. The root cause was the `<;>` combinator, not the simp lemma choice.
- `dsimp only []` after `unfold scanNamedTag` in a goal context: `scanNamedTag` has nested `let` bindings that `simp only []` can't handle but `dsimp only []` reduces correctly.

**Lessons:**
1. When using `split at h <;> (tactic_seq)`, ensure `tactic_seq` is idempotent — it runs on each branch independently, so tactics that already succeeded (like `simp [Except.ok.injEq]`) must not fail when re-run on the post-split state.
2. The `dispatchContent_new_not_placeholder` helper (proving the newly-added token is non-placeholder) was the hardest single theorem — it required unfolding 7 different content scanners through their `emitAt` calls to extract the actual token value.

### Category 2: AUDIT then PROVE (10 theorems, ~$1500 LOC)

These have universal quantifiers over states/positions/values and/or complex invariants.
Adversarial instantiation should be applied **before** investing proof effort.

| # | Theorem | Risk factor | Audit approach | Est. LOC |
|---|---------|-------------|----------------|----------|
| 9e | `scanNextToken_prefix_and_sk_inv` | `∀ s` × disjunctive invariant | Run `scanNextToken` on states with various `sk/ek` configs, check prefix + invariant | 50–100 |
| 9g | `emitList_body_filtered_characterization` | `∀ positions` (ALREADY CAUGHT BUG) | Re-test with 3-level nesting after bracketBalance fix | 40–80 |
| 9h | `emitPairList_body_filtered_characterization` | `∀ positions` (same class) | Re-test with nested maps-in-seqs, seqs-in-maps | 40–80 |
| 9a | `parseStream_emitSequence` (h_pnok sorry) | Parser succeeds on all content-start tokens | `#eval` parseNode at each content-start position in scanned emitter output | 200–400 |
| 9b | `parseStream_emitMapping` (h_pnok sorry) | Same for mappings | Same approach | 200–400 |
| 9c | `emit_roundtrip_sequence_content_eq` | End-to-end content fidelity, `∀ items` | `#eval parseYamlRaw (emit [nested, mixed, values])` and check equality | 150–300 |
| 9d | `emit_roundtrip_mapping_content_eq` | End-to-end for mappings | Same | 150–300 |
| — | `preprocess_preserves_bound` | Loops (`skipToContent`, `unwindIndents`) | Construct states with deep indent stacks, check BoundInv | 80–120 |
| — | `dispatchStructural_preserves_bound` | `scanDirective` loops | Test with ≥5 %YAML/%TAG directives | 60–80 |
| — | `dispatchContent_preserves_bound` | ALL scalar scanner loops | Run each scalar scanner on long/edge-case strings, check BoundInv | 100–150 |

## Adversarial Test Suite Design

### Priority 1: Theorems 9g, 9h (previously caught bug)

These are the highest-value audit targets — we already found one false statement here.
Re-verify after the `flowBracketBalance` fix:

**Inputs:**
```
-- Flat (should pass): ["a", "b", "c"]
-- 1-level nesting: [["a", "b"], "c"]
-- 2-level nesting: [[["a"]]]
-- Mixed: [{"k": "v"}, ["a"]]
-- Map-in-map: {"a": {"b": "c"}}
-- Previously-failing: [{"k1": "v1", "k2": "v2"}]
```

**Check:** For each `flowEntry` at `flowBracketBalance = 0`, verify the next filtered token
is a content-start (scalar/flowSeqStart/flowMapStart) for sequences, or `.key` for mappings.

### Priority 1: Accomplishments

**Test suite:** `Tests/AdversarialInstantiation.lean` — 188 checks, all passing.
Integrated into CI via `lakefile.toml` (`adversarialinstantiation` target) and
the suite runner's verified test suites.

**Test coverage (9g — `emitList_body_filtered_characterization`):**
- Flat sequences: 1, 2, 3 items
- 1-level nesting: `[["a","b"],"c"]`, `[{"k":"v"},"c"]`
- 2-level nesting: `[[["a"]]]`, `[[["a"]],"b"]`
- Mixed: `[{"k":"v"},["a"]]`, `["plain",["a","b"],{"x":"y"}]`
- Previously-failing: `[{"k1":"v1","k2":"v2"}]`, `[{"k1":"v1","k2":"v2"},"after"]`
- Deep: `[[[[deep]]]]`, `[{"a":[{"b":"c"}]}]`
- Edge cases: empty scalar, special chars with escapes, 6-item list

**Test coverage (9h — `emitPairList_body_filtered_characterization`):**
- Single/multi pair: 1, 2, 3 pairs
- Nested values: sequences in values, mappings in values, sequences as keys
- Mixed: `{"items":["x","y"],"count":"2"}`, `{"data":[{"id":"1"},{"id":"2"}],"meta":{"ver":"1.0"}}`
- Deep: `{"k":[[["deep"]]]}`, `{"a":[["1"]],"b":{"c":{"d":"e"}}}`
- Edge cases: empty key, empty value, special chars, 6-pair mapping

**Key verification points:**
1. First body token is content-start (9g) or `.key` (9h) — verified for all inputs
2. Outer-level `flowEntry` (bracketBalance = 0) is always followed by content-start (9g) or `.key` (9h)
3. Inner `flowEntry` tokens (bracketBalance > 0, inside nested brackets) are correctly excluded
4. The `flowBracketBalance` computation correctly distinguishes nesting levels

**Tokens observed (representative):**
- `[{"k1":"v1","k2":"v2"},"after"]` → `streamStart [ { key scalar(k1) : scalar(v1) , key scalar(k2) : scalar(v2) } , scalar(after) ] streamEnd`
  - Inner `,` at position 8 has bal=1 (inside `{}`), correctly skipped
  - Outer `,` at position 12 has bal=0, next is `scalar(after)` ✓

### Priority 1: Reflections

**Confidence level:** HIGH. The test suite covers the exact input patterns that previously
triggered a false statement (nested mappings inside sequences where inner `flowEntry` tokens
at non-zero bracket balance were incorrectly required to be followed by content-start). The
`flowBracketBalance` fix (theorems 9i–9l, now proven) correctly distinguishes inner vs outer
commas.

**What was verified:**
- The `flowBracketBalance` predicate accurately identifies outer-level commas
- All 7 content scanner types (scalar variants, nested `[`, nested `{`) produce the expected
  first filtered token
- The `, ` separator between items produces exactly one `.flowEntry` token at the right
  nesting level

**Residual risk:** LOW. The adversarial inputs include the previously-failing case and several
more complex nesting patterns. No new failures discovered. The theorem statements align with
observed scanner behavior.

### Priority 2: Theorems 9c, 9d (end-to-end round-trip)

These are directly checkable via `emit → scanFiltered → parseYamlRaw → contentEq`:

**Inputs:**
```
-- Scalars: "hello", "with \"escape\"", ""
-- Sequences: ["a"], ["a", "b"], [["nested"]]
-- Mappings: {"k": "v"}, {"k1": "v1", "k2": "v2"}
-- Nested: [{"k": ["a", "b"]}, "c"]
-- Deep: [[[[["deep"]]]]]
```

**Check:** `contentEq (parseYamlRaw (emit v)).get! v = true`

### Priority 2: Accomplishments

**Test suite:** `Tests/AdversarialInstantiation.lean` — 141 new checks (329 total), all passing.

**Test coverage (scalars — base case for both 9c and 9d):**
- Plain text, empty string, escape sequences (`\"`, `\n`, `\t`, `\\`)
- Null byte (`\u0000`), colon-space (`key: value`), hash (`not # a comment`)
- Brackets/braces in scalar content (`[not, a, sequence]`, `{not: a, mapping}`)

**Test coverage (9c — `emit_roundtrip_sequence_content_eq`):**
- Empty sequence, 1/2/3-item flat, nested 1–4 levels deep
- Sequences containing mappings (single-pair & multi-pair)
- Mixed nesting: `[plain, [a, b], {x: y}]`, `[{a: [{b: c}]}]`
- Edge cases: empty scalars, special chars, 8-item list
- Previously-failing pattern: `[{k1: v1, k2: v2}, after]`

**Test coverage (9d — `emit_roundtrip_mapping_content_eq`):**
- Empty mapping, 1/2/3-pair flat, nested 1–3 levels deep
- Mappings with sequence values (flat & nested)
- Mixed nesting: `{items: [x, y], count: 2}`, `{data: [{id: 1}, {id: 2}], meta: {ver: 1.0}}`
- Deep nesting: 5-level sequences, 5-level mappings
- Sequence keys, mapping keys (complex key structures)
- Edge cases: empty key, empty value, special chars, 6-pair mapping
- Cross-nested: `[{key: [{inner: [a, b]}]}]`

**Key verification points:**
1. `parseYamlRaw (emit v)` succeeds for every test input
2. Exactly 1 document is produced in all cases
3. `contentEq v (composed[0]!.value) = true` — original value is content-equivalent
   to the round-tripped result for all 47 distinct `YamlValue` inputs

### Priority 2: Reflections

**Confidence level:** HIGH. The round-trip property holds across all tested inputs,
including adversarial scalar content (escape sequences, YAML metacharacters embedded
in strings), deeply nested structures (5 levels), and complex key types (sequence
and mapping keys).

**What was verified:**
- The emitter produces valid YAML that parses back correctly for all tested structures
- `contentEq` correctly ignores style differences (emitter always uses double-quoted/flow,
  parser may assign different styles)
- Nested structures round-trip faithfully: the recursive `contentEq` check passes
  through all nesting levels
- Complex keys (sequences and mappings as mapping keys) are handled correctly

**Residual risk:** LOW. The theorem requires an inductive hypothesis (`ih`/`ihk`/`ihv`)
for recursive sub-values; our tests cover the recursive structure up to 5 levels deep.
The base case (empty collections) is already proven in the theorem. The remaining sorry
is in the `_ :: _` branch — the non-empty inductive case.

### Priority 3: Theorems 9a, 9b (parser fuel sufficiency)

The claim `4 * tokens.size + 4` as fuel bound is testable:

**Check:** `parseFlowSequence tokens 0 (4 * tokens.size + 4)` returns `.ok` for scanned
emitter output. Also test with `4 * tokens.size + 3` (one less) to verify tightness.

### Priority 3: Accomplishments

- **180 new checks** (509 total: 188 P1 + 141 P2 + 180 P3), all passing
- Tested `parseStream (scanFiltered (emit v))` succeeds for 45 adversarial inputs spanning:
  - **Sequences (9a):** empty, 1–16 elements, depth 2–7, wide+deep, mixed nesting with mappings, previously-failing inner-comma patterns
  - **Mappings (9b):** empty, 1–16 entries, depth 2–6, sequence/mapping keys, complex nested values
  - **Cross-type:** alternating seq/map nesting, wide at multiple levels, realistic multi-level structures
- Each input checks: (1) scan success, (2) `parseStream` returns `.ok`, (3) exactly 1 document, (4) tightness — `parseNode` at pos=1 with fuel `4*N+3` (one less than `parseDocument` uses)
- **Tightness finding:** `4*N+3` suffices for ALL tested inputs — the bound `4*N+4` has at least 1 unit of slack. No input found that requires exactly `4*N+4`.
- Token counts range from N=4 (empty seq/map) to N=84 (map-width-16), exercising fuel from 19 to 340

### Priority 3: Reflections

- **The fuel bound is not tight.** Every tested input succeeded with fuel `4*N+3`. This means the `+4` constant in `4*N+4` has margin. This is actually desirable for proof robustness: a non-tight bound is easier to prove because there's no single worst-case input to characterize.
- **Fuel scales linearly with tokens**, which scales linearly with structure size. Deep nesting adds ~8 tokens per level (open+close brackets + content + comma overhead). Wide structures add ~4 tokens per entry (content + comma + key/value for maps). The `4×` factor in `4*N` comfortably covers both.
- **No counterexample found** for the fuel sufficiency claim across diverse structures up to depth 7 and width 16. The sorry'd `ParseNodeFlowSeqOk`/`ParseEntryFlowMapOk` predicates appear sound.
- **Residual risk:** LOW. The fuel bound `4*N+4` is conservative with slack. The only remaining risk would be pathological token sequences not producible by the emitter (but the theorems restrict to emitter output via the `h_scan` hypothesis).
- **Proof strategy hint:** Since `4*N+3` also works, a proof via induction on fuel could use `4*N+4` - 1 for the recursive call without worrying about off-by-one at the base.

### Priority 4: Theorem 9e (scanner prefix invariant)

**Inputs:** Construct `ScannerState` values with:
- `simpleKey.possible = true, tokenIndex < n` (restored from flowStack)
- `explicitKeyLine = some _` (after scanValue)
- Both conditions false (normal flow)

**Check:** After `scanNextToken`, verify prefix preserved AND disjunctive condition maintained.

### Priority 4: Accomplishments

- **168 new checks** (677 total: 188 P1 + 141 P2 + 180 P3 + 168 P4), all passing
- Tested `scanNextToken` step-by-step on **55 diverse YAML inputs** spanning:
  - **Flow indicators:** empty/flat/nested sequences and mappings, 1–5 levels deep
  - **Quoted scalars:** double-quoted, single-quoted, escape sequences, unicode
  - **Block scalars:** literal (`|`), folded (`>`)
  - **Block sequences:** flat, nested, 1–10 items
  - **Block mappings:** flat, nested 1–6 levels deep
  - **Explicit keys:** `?`/`:` syntax in block and flow
  - **Document markers:** `---`, `...`, multi-document
  - **Directives:** `%YAML 1.2`, `%TAG`
  - **Mixed flow/block:** block with flow values/keys
  - **Comments:** line, inline, comment-only
  - **Anchors/aliases:** `&anc`, `*anc` in block and flow
  - **Tags:** `!!str`, verbatim `!<...>`
  - **Emitter output:** same adversarial inputs from P1–P3
  - **Stress tests:** deep block nesting, wide sequences, kitchen-sink multi-doc
- Each input checks at every `scanNextToken` step (3–35 steps per input):
  1. No scan errors
  2. **Prefix preservation** for corrected `n` (using first disjunct only)
  3. **SK/EK invariant maintenance** (output disjunction)
  4. **Original disjunct diagnostic** — counts steps where `∨ ek=none` would allow unsafe `n`

**CRITICAL FINDING: Theorem statement has a false disjunction.**

The original `h_cond` precondition:
```
(s.simpleKey.possible → s.simpleKey.tokenIndex ≥ n) ∨ s.explicitKeyLine = none
```
The second disjunct (`explicitKeyLine = none`) is **insufficient** for prefix preservation.
Counterexample: `"a: b"` at step 1 — state has `sk.possible=true, sk.tokenIndex=1,
ek=none`. The scanner encounters `:` and overwrites `tokens[1]` (placeholder → `.key`),
violating prefix preservation for `n=4` (= `s.tokens.size`) even though `ek=none`.

**46 of 55 inputs** exhibit steps where the original disjunction allows unsafe `n`.
Prefix preservation holds correctly when `n` is restricted to
`min(s.simpleKey.tokenIndex, s.tokens.size)` when `sk.possible=true`.

**Corrected precondition should be:**
```
s.simpleKey.possible = true → s.simpleKey.tokenIndex ≥ n
```
(no `∨ explicitKeyLine = none` escape clause for prefix preservation).
The `∨ explicitKeyLine = none` is still needed in the **conclusion** (output invariant)
to maintain the inductive chain.

### Priority 4: Reflections

- **Adversarial instantiation caught a false theorem statement.** This is the second time (after the `flowBracketBalance` fix in P1) that testing found a provably false claim. The `∨ explicitKeyLine = none` disjunct in the precondition allows prefix preservation to be claimed for indices above `simpleKey.tokenIndex`, where the scanner actively overwrites placeholder tokens.
- **The corrected invariant works.** All 55 inputs pass with prefix preservation restricted to `n ≤ simpleKey.tokenIndex` (when `sk.possible`). The SK/EK output invariant is also maintained at every step.
- **The issue is subtle.** `explicitKeyLine` and `simpleKey` are independent scanner mechanisms. `explicitKeyLine = none` means no explicit `?` key is active; it says nothing about whether the implicit simple-key mechanism will overwrite a placeholder. The disjunction conflates two unrelated conditions.
- **Impact on proof effort:** The theorem statement must be corrected before the proof can succeed. The fix is straightforward — remove the `∨ explicitKeyLine = none` from the precondition and keep it only in the conclusion. The `ScanChain_preserves_raw_prefix` usage site may need adjustment to track the first conjunct through the chain.
- **Residual risk:** LOW for the corrected statement. Prefix preservation below `simpleKey.tokenIndex` and SK/EK invariant maintenance are both empirically verified across all 55 inputs with no failures.

### Priority 4: Theorem Repair

**Theorems repaired (3):**

| Theorem | Location | Fix |
|---------|----------|-----|
| `scanNextToken_prefix_and_sk_inv` | EmitterScannability.lean:6623 | Removed `∨ s.explicitKeyLine = none` from **precondition**. Conclusion's disjunction kept (needed for flow close). |
| `ScanChain_preserves_raw_prefix` | EmitterScannability.lean:6644 | Removed `∨ s.explicitKeyLine = none` from **precondition**. Proof changed to `sorry` (was a structural proof relying on the false per-step theorem). |
| `ScanChain_filtered_prefix` | EmitterScannability.lean:7436 | **Statement unchanged** (it IS correct). Proof changed to `sorry` — old proof went through `ScanChain_preserves_raw_prefix` with `n₀ = tokens.size`, which requires the now-removed disjunction. Needs restructuring via non-placeholder preservation argument. |

**Design decisions:**

1. **Why keep the disjunction in the conclusion?** Computational testing showed that `sk'.possible → tokenIndex ≥ n` (without `∨ ek'=none`) FAILS for 26/55 inputs at the per-step level. Flow close (`]`/`}`) restores a simpleKey from the stack with `tokenIndex` potentially < `n`, but `ek` is `none` in those cases. The disjunction in the OUTPUT is genuine.

2. **Why the chain theorem needs a different proof strategy:** The per-step conclusion gives `(sk'.possible → tokenIndex ≥ n₀) ∨ ek' = none`, but the next step's precondition needs the strong `sk'.possible → tokenIndex ≥ n₀` (no disjunction). When the disjunction gives `ek' = none`, a separate argument is needed. For typical `n₀` values (= initial `min(sk.tokenIndex, tokens.size)`, usually 1), the strong invariant holds trivially. The proof requires showing that stack-restored tokenIndices are ≥ n₀.

3. **Why `ScanChain_filtered_prefix`'s statement is correct despite the disjunction:** The filtered prefix (excluding `.placeholder` tokens) IS preserved even when `tokens[sk.tokenIndex]` is overwritten, because `tokens[sk.tokenIndex]` is always a `.placeholder` (filtered OUT in both states). The proof needs to use this insight rather than going through raw prefix preservation.

**Sorry count impact:** 11 → 13 warnings. The 2 new sorrys (`ScanChain_preserves_raw_prefix`, `ScanChain_filtered_prefix`) were previously "proven" but relied on a false sorry'd theorem — their proofs compiled but were unsound. Making them explicit sorrys is the honest fix.

**New adversarial tests added (20 chain-level checks):**
- 10 representative inputs tested with a **fixed `n₀`** across all scanning steps
- Each input checks both chain-level prefix preservation AND the strong SK invariant
- All 20/20 pass, confirming the corrected chain theorem's claim for `n₀ = min(sk₀.tokenIndex, tokens₀.size)`

**Final test total:** 697/697 (was 677 before repair; +20 chain-level tests).

### Priority 5: ScannerBound theorems (preprocess, structural, content)

**Inputs:** States with:
- 10+ indent stack entries (deep `unwindIndents`)
- Multi-line scalars (long scanner loops)
- UTF-8 multi-byte characters (byte offset arithmetic)

**Check:** `BoundInv` fields (offset ≤ utf8ByteSize, isValidPos, etc.) after processing.

## Implementation Plan

All adversarial instantiation tests live in `Tests/AdversarialInstantiation.lean` and are
integrated into CI:

- **Build target:** `adversarialinstantiation` (in `lakefile.toml` `defaultTargets`)
- **Standalone runner:** `Tests/AdversarialInstantiation/Runner.lean` → `.lake/build/bin/adversarialinstantiation`
- **Suite runner:** Included via `Tests.AdversarialInstantiation.collectTests` in `Tests/SuiteRunner/Main.lean`
- **Report:** Appears in HTML/JSON reports as "Adversarial Instantiation Tests (sorry audit)"

For each priority:
1. Add test functions (`test9g`, `test9h`, ...) and register in `collectTests`
2. Use `TestCollector` + `check`/`checkM` macros for VerifiedSuiteResult integration
3. Any check failure → investigate and fix the theorem statement before proving
4. All checks pass → proceed to proof with increased confidence

**Status:** Priority 1 complete (188/188). Priority 2 complete (141/141). Priority 3 complete (180/180). Priority 4 complete (168→697 checks after repair, **false theorem found and repaired**). Total: 697/697. Priority 5 to be added.
