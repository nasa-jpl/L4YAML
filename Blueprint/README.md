# L4YAML Blueprint

A top-down specification of L4YAML: what it **is**, what it **guarantees**,
and how those guarantees decompose into modules and theorems.

This blueprint was introduced on 2026-04-21 after a bottom-up proof
effort (`parser_fuel_mono_succ` and related `_mono_zero` theorems)
exposed that the repository was accumulating theorems without a
top-down anchor. Specifically:

- `parseBlockSequence_mono_zero` (and siblings) turned out to be
  **unsound as stated** — the statement was written by analogy with
  flow-sequence monotonicity without reference to a caller's need.
- The enclosing `parser_fuel_mono_succ` machinery (~500 LoC, 24
  sub-theorems, 28 `sorry`s) was built to unlock **one** downstream
  call site, and its two documented consumer wrappers
  (`parseNode_fuel_mono_succ`, `parseSinglePairMapping_fuel_mono_succ`)
  have **zero** callers outside their own definitions.
- The companion adversarial-instantiation suite (1,827 lines, 7
  priorities) does **not** exercise any of the 24 fuel-monotonicity
  parts; its "Priority 7 audit" only covers a lifted helper.

The purpose of this blueprint is to make the proof effort
**goal-driven** rather than **accumulation-driven**: every lemma
should justify itself by traceable use in a capstone theorem, and
every capstone theorem should be declared *before* its proof is
attempted.

## How to read this blueprint

Read in order on first visit:

1. [`01-terminology.md`](01-terminology.md) — what the domain words
   mean in L4YAML. Establishes shared vocabulary.
2. [`02-architecture.md`](02-architecture.md) — the pipeline, data
   flow, and module boundaries.
3. [`03-code-organization.md`](03-code-organization.md) — proposed
   folder layout (code first; proofs to follow).
4. [`04-capstones.md`](04-capstones.md) — the complete list of
   capstone theorems, grouped by guarantee category, with current
   status (✅ proved / ⏳ planned / 🚧 partial / ❓ unsound /
   🗑 deletion candidate).
5. [`05-current-state.md`](05-current-state.md) — honest accounting
   of where we are: sorry count, deletion candidates, claims that
   need reconciling against reality (`Overview.lean` says "Zero
   `sorry`" — that is aspirational; actual grep shows ~100).
6. [`06-discipline.md`](06-discipline.md) — the discipline going
   forward: blueprint-first theorem proposals, adversarial
   instantiation before proof, sorry policy.

## Relationship to existing documentation

This blueprint **does not replace** the Verso-based manual at
[`doc/Doc/L4YAML/`](../doc/Doc/L4YAML/). That manual is a
published-audience document. This blueprint is an **internal
working document** that drives the proof backlog. Eventually
(per point (b) of the pivot conversation), the blueprint may be
refactored using `verso-blueprint` so that capstones can be
cross-linked with their Lean definitions directly; until then,
markdown is the medium.

## Relationship to existing plan docs

[`../PARSER_WELLBEHAVED_PLAN.md`](../PARSER_WELLBEHAVED_PLAN.md),
[`../EMITTER_SCANNABILITY_PLAN.md`](../EMITTER_SCANNABILITY_PLAN.md),
and similar plan documents at the repository root are **tactical**
plans tied to specific proof files. The blueprint is **strategic**:
it says *which properties matter* and *why*, from which the tactical
plans derive. When a tactical plan's premise no longer aligns with
the blueprint (as happened with `parser_fuel_mono_succ`), the
blueprint wins.

## Contributor workflow

Before proposing a new theorem:

1. Locate (or add) a capstone in [`04-capstones.md`](04-capstones.md)
   that needs this theorem as a dependency.
2. Add the theorem's statement to the relevant module's section in
   that file *before* attempting the proof.
3. Add an adversarial-instantiation test that would refute the
   statement if false, *before* attempting the proof.
4. Prove it; update status in [`05-current-state.md`](05-current-state.md).

This sequence catches statement errors at step 3 (cheap) rather
than step 4 (expensive).

## Recommended work plan

The blueprint as written (2026-04-21) is a *description* of the
target state. This section lays out the concrete initiatives that
move the repository toward it. Two initiatives run in parallel: a
**code reorganization** driven by
[`03-code-organization.md`](03-code-organization.md), and a
**mechanical capstone verification** that cross-checks
[`04-capstones.md`](04-capstones.md) against the actual Lean
dependency graph.

### Initiative 1 — Code reorganization

<details>
<summary>

Goal: make every terminology entry in
[`01-terminology.md`](01-terminology.md) findable in ≤ 2 clicks
from the top of `L4YAML/`. Four phases; each phase is one PR,
each PR ends on a green build.

</summary>

#### **Phase 1 — Non-code moves (risk: low) ✅ done 2026-04-21**

<details>

Landed as `ad12e204` (12 top-level files into
`Spec/`, `Parser/`, `Output/`, `Config/`, `FFI/`, `Token/`,
`Scanner/`) and `573fa76e` (Phase 1b — `Schema.lean` and
`Surface.lean` moved into their folders as
`Schema/Schema.lean` / `Surface/Surface.lean` for symmetry).

- **Tooling used**: `git mv` for each file; one `sed` pass over
  `^import L4YAML.Foo$` for imports; `lake build` gate.
- **Scripts**:
  [`scripts/refactor-phase-1.sh`](../scripts/refactor-phase-1.sh),
  [`scripts/refactor-phase-1b.sh`](../scripts/refactor-phase-1b.sh)
  — reversible via commit revert.
- **Acceptance**: `lake build` passes 429/429 with only the
  expected baseline sorry warnings; smoke tests green.
- **Blast radius (observed)**: ~110 files touched across `L4YAML/`,
  `Tests/`, `L4YAML.lean`, `gen-suite-guards.py`. `L4YAML.FGM` and
  the Doc/Verso files had no direct imports of the moved modules
  and did not need updates.

</details>

#### **Phase 2 — Scanner split (risk: medium) ✅ done 2026-04-21**

<details>

Broke monolithic `L4YAML/Scanner/Scanner.lean` (~2761 LoC, not the
~920 LoC originally estimated) into seven submodules:
[`State.lean`](../L4YAML/Scanner/State.lean),
[`Whitespace.lean`](../L4YAML/Scanner/Whitespace.lean),
[`Indent.lean`](../L4YAML/Scanner/Indent.lean),
[`Document.lean`](../L4YAML/Scanner/Document.lean),
[`NodeProperties.lean`](../L4YAML/Scanner/NodeProperties.lean),
[`Scalar.lean`](../L4YAML/Scanner/Scalar.lean),
[`SimpleKey.lean`](../L4YAML/Scanner/SimpleKey.lean).
[`Scanner/Scanner.lean`](../L4YAML/Scanner/Scanner.lean) (~560 LoC)
became the dispatch umbrella owning flow-collection indicator
scanners and the `scanNextToken` / `scan` / `scanLoop` main loop.
The blueprint originally listed six submodules; `NodeProperties.lean`
was added to give YAML §6.9 (anchors + aliases + tags) its own home,
matching the spec-section pattern used by the other submodules
(`Whitespace` ≈ §6.1–§6.7, `Document` ≈ §6.8 + §9.1.2,
`Scalar` ≈ §7.3 + §8.1, `SimpleKey` ≈ §7.4 + §8.2).

- **Tooling used**: `Write` for the seven new files; `Edit` for the
  blueprint and Verso-doc cross-references; `lake build` gate.
- **Acceptance met**: `lake build` 443/443 (warnings only on
  pre-existing `sorry`s in `ParserWellBehaved.lean` and
  `EmitterScannability.lean` baselines); `scannertests` 32/32,
  `scannerspecexamples` 132/132, `validationtests` 84/84,
  `rawparsetests` 29/29; `Architecture.lean` updated to list all
  seven submodules.
- **Blast radius**: zero changes to consumers — every submodule
  declares `namespace L4YAML.Scanner`, and `Scanner/Scanner.lean`
  re-imports them, so `import L4YAML.Scanner.Scanner` continues to
  see the same public API.  ~28 importing files unchanged.
- **Annotations added**: while splitting, defs that implement a
  named YAML 1.2.2 production but lacked `@[yaml_spec ...]` were
  tagged: `collectCommentTextLoop`, `skipBlankLinesLoop`,
  `collectPlainScalar_terminates?`, `collectPlainScalar_handleBlockLineBreak`,
  `consumeExactSpaces`, `collectLineContentLoop`,
  `autoDetectBlockScalarIndent*`, `validateTrailingContent`,
  `skipDocEndWhitespace`, `skipTrailingSpaces`, `isBlockEntryCandidate`,
  `isKeyCandidate`, `scanNextToken_dispatch{Structural,FlowIndicators,
  BlockIndicators,Content}`, `scanNextToken_preprocess`,
  `scanNextToken_checkBlockFlowIndent`, `scanFiltered`, `scanLoopFull`,
  `scanWithComments`, plus the `Loop`-suffixed helpers for spec
  productions whose terminating wrapper was already tagged.

</details>

#### **Phase 3 — Parser split (risk: medium) ✅ done 2026-04-21**

<details>

Broke monolithic `L4YAML/Parser/TokenParser.lean` (~1191 LoC) into
four files along its existing logical seams:
[`State.lean`](../L4YAML/Parser/State.lean) (~285 LoC) holds
`ParseState`, the navigation/consumption accessors,
`NodeProperties`, `parseNodeProperties`, `resolveTag`, `emptyNode`,
`applyNodeFinalization`, and `validateNodeProps` — everything the
mutual block touches but that doesn't itself recurse.
[`Fuel.lean`](../L4YAML/Parser/Fuel.lean) (~50 LoC) factors out the
`initialFuel := 4 * tokens.size + 4` formula referenced by
`parseDocument` and proof capstones.
[`TokenParser.lean`](../L4YAML/Parser/TokenParser.lean) (~535 LoC)
keeps the 14-function mutually-recursive block plus
`StreamState` / `validNextToken`, `parseDirectives`,
`prepareDocumentState`, `parseDocument`, and `parseStream` — i.e.
everything that depends on the recursive descent and the document
boundary table.
[`Composition.lean`](../L4YAML/Parser/Composition.lean) (~205 LoC)
is the new umbrella holding the user-facing pipeline: `scanAndParse`,
`parseYaml{,Raw,Single,SingleRaw}`, the comment classifiers
(`classifyCommentPosition`, `classifyDocumentComments`,
`partitionCommentsByDocument`), and `parseYamlWithComments`.

- **Tooling used**: `Write` for the four files; bulk `Python`
  substitution to redirect 48 importers from
  `import L4YAML.Parser.TokenParser` to
  `import L4YAML.Parser.Composition` (transitive imports keep the
  `L4YAML.TokenParser.foo` API surface intact); `Edit` for the
  blueprint and Verso-doc cross-references; `lake build` gate.
- **Acceptance met**: `lake build` 449/449 (warnings only on
  pre-existing `sorry`s in `ParserWellBehaved.lean` and
  `EmitterScannability.lean` baselines).  Test suites observed:
  `rawparsetests` 29/29, `validationtests` 84/84, `flowtests` 88/88,
  `explicitkeytests` 149/149, `scannertests` 32/32,
  `scannerspecexamples` 132/132, `dumproundtrip` 117/117,
  `specexamples` 132/132, `propertytests` 124/124,
  `productioncoverage` 26/26, `adversarialinstantiation`
  2455/2473 (the 18 failures are the same pre-existing semantic-gap
  baseline, unchanged by the refactor).
  `Architecture.lean` updated to list all four files.
- **Blast radius**: 49 importing files updated by a one-line
  substitution; no behavioural changes. The only file that still
  imports `L4YAML.Parser.TokenParser` directly is
  `L4YAML/Parser/Composition.lean` itself — by design, since
  Composition wraps the mutual block.
- **Why one umbrella, not the literal blueprint**: the original
  blueprint text envisioned `TokenParser.lean` keeping its public
  API; in practice `parseYaml*` had to move into Composition.lean to
  avoid a circular import (Composition needs `parseStream` from the
  mutual block).  Routing imports through Composition.lean keeps
  the user-facing API name stable (`L4YAML.TokenParser.parseYaml`)
  while honouring the file-layout intent.

</details>

#### **Phase 4 — Proofs reorganization (risk: low per-cluster)**

<details>

Move [`L4YAML/Proofs/*.lean`](../L4YAML/Proofs/) into role-named
subfolders (Foundation/, Errors/, Schema/, Contracts/, Production/,
Scanner/, Output/, Parser/, Coupling/, RoundTrip/). One cluster per
PR; each leaves build green.

- **Ordering principle**: Foundation/ first (low-level utilities,
  few inbound references), then clusters in order of coupling
  (Scanner/ before Parser/ before the Composition.lean capstone).
  Within that constraint, smaller/less-coupled clusters come first
  to keep risk monotonic.
- **Mechanical pattern** (established by PR 1): `git mv` + anchored
  `sed` over `^import L4YAML.Proofs.Foo$`. Namespaces stay at
  `L4YAML.Proofs.Foo` (no rename into the subcluster path) so
  consumer `open` statements work unchanged — same precedent as
  Phase 1.
- **Acceptance per PR**: `lake build` green; the
  capstone-regeneration pipeline from Initiative 2 still produces
  the same dependency graph before and after.
- **Overlap resolutions** (where the draft target layout in
  [`03-code-organization.md`](03-code-organization.md) listed a
  file under two subfolders):
    - `*Coupling.lean` files (SurfaceCoupling, ScalarCoupling,
      StructureCoupling) → **Coupling/** (role-based home). The
      `Surface/` subcluster is dropped — its only listed contents
      were these coupling files, and `Surface.lean` itself is code,
      not proofs.
    - `DumpRoundTrip.lean` → **Output/** (proof about the Dump
      function), not `Document/`.
    - `CommentProperties.lean` (unlisted in the draft) →
      **RoundTrip/**, paired with `CommentRoundTrip.lean`.
    - `ScannerPlainContent.lean` (unlisted) → **Scanner/**.
    - The draft's `Document/` subcluster is renamed to
      **Contracts/** and holds just the two contract files
      (`BlockScalarContracts`, `DocumentContracts`).

</details>

#### **Cluster roadmap (10 PRs, Foundation + 9 remaining)**

<details>

| PR | Cluster | Files | LoC (approx) | Capstone groups | Risk |
| -- | ------- | ----: | -----------: | --------------- | ---- |
| 1 | Foundation/ ✅ | 4 | ~1,100 | (infra only) | low |
| 2 | Errors/ ✅ | 3 | ~900 | — | low |
| 3 | Schema/ ✅ | 4 | ~850 | 5 (SchemaResolution), 6 (SchemaDump, SchemaComposition) | low |
| 4 | Contracts/ ✅ | 2 | ~500 | — | low |
| 5 | Production/ ✅ | 7 | ~7,500 | 7 (all production theorems) | medium |
| 6 | Scanner/ ✅ | 18 | ~9,700 | 2 (all scanner correctness), 6 partial, 7 partial | medium (size) |
| 7 | Output/ ✅ | 3 | ~11,000 | 6 (EmitterScannability, ScannerEmitBridge, DumpRoundTrip) | medium (EmitterScannability is ~10k LoC) |
| 8 | Parser/ ✅ | 9 | ~12,000 | 3 (all parser correctness) | medium (size + mutual-rec imports) |
| 9 | Coupling/ ✅ | 5 | ~2,400 | 8 (all surface coupling), 7 boundary | low |
| 10 | RoundTrip/ ✅ | 4 | ~2,200 | 6 (RoundTrip, RoundTripComposition, CommentRoundTrip) | low |

**Capstones that stay at `Proofs/` root** (not moved into subclusters
— they are the top-down anchors of
[`04-capstones.md`](04-capstones.md)):
[`Composition.lean`](../L4YAML/Proofs/Composition.lean),
[`Completeness.lean`](../L4YAML/Proofs/Completeness.lean),
[`Soundness.lean`](../L4YAML/Proofs/Soundness.lean),

- **Acceptance met**: `lake build` 449/449 (same pre-existing
  `sorry` warnings as the prior clusters).
- **Note on count**: the roadmap row above was drafted as 17 files;
  the target layout in `03-code-organization.md` and the detailed
  bullet list in this README both enumerate 18 (including
  `ScannerPlainContent.lean`, which was added to the Scanner/ cluster

#### **Phase 4 · Output/ ✅ done 2026-04-22**

<details>

Moved three emitter/dumper-correctness proofs into
[`L4YAML/Proofs/Output/`](../L4YAML/Proofs/Output/):

[`ScannerEmitBridge.lean`](../L4YAML/Proofs/Output/ScannerEmitBridge.lean),
[`DumpRoundTrip.lean`](../L4YAML/Proofs/Output/DumpRoundTrip.lean).

- **Tooling used**: same pattern as the Foundation/, Errors/,
  Schema/, Contracts/, Production/, and Scanner/ clusters —
  `git mv` + one anchored `sed` pass over
  `^import L4YAML.Proofs.Foo$`.  The one internal cross-import
  (`EmitterScannability` → `ScannerEmitBridge`) was rewritten
  in-place by the same sed pass.  Namespaces left untouched.
- **Script**:
  [`scripts/refactor-phase-7-output.sh`](../scripts/refactor-phase-7-output.sh)
  — reversible via commit revert.
- **Acceptance met**: `lake build` 449/449 (same pre-existing

  declarations at lines 8169, 8665, 8757, 8839, 9057, 9773, 9812
  of the moved file — carried over unchanged from the baseline).
- **Blast radius**: 3 renames + external importers rewritten
  (`L4YAML.lean` three import lines; `Tests/DumpRoundTrip.lean`

#### **Phase 4 · Parser/ ✅ done 2026-04-22**

<details>

Moved nine parser-correctness proofs into
[`L4YAML/Proofs/Parser/`](../L4YAML/Proofs/Parser/):

[`ParserGrammableBase.lean`](../L4YAML/Proofs/Parser/ParserGrammableBase.lean).

- **Tooling used**: same pattern as the Foundation/, Errors/,
  Schema/, Contracts/, Production/, Scanner/, and Output/ clusters —
  `git mv` + one anchored `sed` pass over
  `^import L4YAML.Proofs.Foo$`.  The cluster's mutual-recursion
  internal imports (seven cross-import lines across
  `ParserWellBehaved`, `ParserAnchorProofs`, `ParserGrammable`,
  `ParserWfaProofs`, `ParserNodeProofs`, `ParserCorrectness`, and
  `ParserCompleteness`) were rewritten in-place by the same sed

  introduced by this cluster).
- **Blast radius**: 9 renames + external importers rewritten

#### **Phase 4 · Coupling/ ✅ done 2026-04-22**

<details>

Moved five scanner↔surface↔grammar coupling proofs into
[`L4YAML/Proofs/Coupling/`](../L4YAML/Proofs/Coupling/):
[`CouplingBridge.lean`](../L4YAML/Proofs/Coupling/CouplingBridge.lean),
[`ScannerCoupling.lean`](../L4YAML/Proofs/Coupling/ScannerCoupling.lean),
[`SurfaceCoupling.lean`](../L4YAML/Proofs/Coupling/SurfaceCoupling.lean),
[`StructureCoupling.lean`](../L4YAML/Proofs/Coupling/StructureCoupling.lean),
[`ScalarCoupling.lean`](../L4YAML/Proofs/Coupling/ScalarCoupling.lean).

- **Tooling used**: same pattern as the Foundation/, Errors/,
  Schema/, Contracts/, Production/, Scanner/, Output/, and Parser/
  clusters — `git mv` + one anchored `sed` pass over
  `^import L4YAML.Proofs.Foo$`.  Three internal cross-import lines
  (`ScannerCoupling` → `CouplingBridge`, `ScalarCoupling` →
  `ScannerCoupling`, `StructureCoupling` → `ScalarCoupling`) were
  rewritten in-place by the same sed pass.  Namespaces left untouched.
- **Script**:
  [`scripts/refactor-phase-9-coupling.sh`](../scripts/refactor-phase-9-coupling.sh)
  — reversible via commit revert.
- **Acceptance met**: `lake build` 449/449 (same pre-existing
  `sorry` warnings in `Output/EmitterScannability.lean` carried
  over unchanged from the baseline — no new warnings or failures
  introduced by this cluster).
- **Note on count**: the roadmap row above was drafted as 6 files;
  the target layout in this README and in `03-code-organization.md`
  both enumerate 5.  The row is now ✅ at 5 — the sixth file in the
  original draft never existed in the flat layout.
- **Blast radius**: 5 renames + external importers rewritten
  (`L4YAML.lean` five import lines;
  `L4YAML/Proofs/Production/StructureProduction.lean` one line;
  `L4YAML/Proofs/Production/PreprocessProduction.lean` one line;
  `L4YAML/Proofs/Production/ScalarProduction.lean` one line;
  `L4YAML/Proofs/Scanner/ScanStrictCoupling.lean` one line;
  `L4YAML/Proofs/Output/EmitterScannability.lean` two lines) +
  three internal cross-imports + narrative references in
  `Blueprint/README.md` and `Blueprint/03-code-organization.md`.

</details>

#### **Phase 4 · RoundTrip/ ✅ done 2026-04-22**

<details>

Moved the four round-trip and comment-channel proofs into
[`L4YAML/Proofs/RoundTrip/`](../L4YAML/Proofs/RoundTrip/):
[`RoundTrip.lean`](../L4YAML/Proofs/RoundTrip/RoundTrip.lean),
[`RoundTripComposition.lean`](../L4YAML/Proofs/RoundTrip/RoundTripComposition.lean),
[`CommentRoundTrip.lean`](../L4YAML/Proofs/RoundTrip/CommentRoundTrip.lean),
[`CommentProperties.lean`](../L4YAML/Proofs/RoundTrip/CommentProperties.lean).
This closes **Initiative 1 Phase 4** — every non-umbrella proof file
now lives inside a role-named subfolder.

- **Tooling used**: same pattern as the nine preceding clusters —
  `git mv` + one anchored `sed` pass over `^import L4YAML.Proofs.Foo$`.
  No intra-cluster imports existed among the four files (pure renames,
  100% similarity).  Namespaces left untouched.
- **Script**:
  [`scripts/refactor-phase-10-roundtrip.sh`](../scripts/refactor-phase-10-roundtrip.sh)
  — reversible via commit revert.
- **Acceptance met**: `lake build` 449/449 (same pre-existing
  `sorry` warnings in `Output/EmitterScannability.lean` carried
  over unchanged from the baseline — no new warnings or failures
  introduced by this cluster).
- **Blast radius**: 4 renames + external importers rewritten
  (`L4YAML.lean` four import lines;
  `L4YAML/Proofs/Scanner/ScannerDoubleQuoted.lean` one line;
  `L4YAML/Proofs/Output/ScannerEmitBridge.lean` one line;
  `L4YAML/Proofs/Output/EmitterScannability.lean` one line;
  `Tests/Guards/Proofs/RoundTrip.lean` one line;
  `Tests/Guards/Proofs/RoundTripComposition.lean` one line) +
  narrative references in `Blueprint/README.md` and
  `Blueprint/03-code-organization.md`.

**Overall exit criterion for Initiative 1**: `Architecture.lean`
can be regenerated from the actual folder layout instead of
hand-maintained; no top-level `.lean` file in `L4YAML/` besides
the `L4YAML.lean` umbrella (i.e. the repo-root library entry
point that re-exports submodules) — every other file lives inside
a role-named folder.

### Initiative 2 — Mechanical capstone verification

<details>
<summary>

Goal: compare the human-written [`04-capstones.md`](04-capstones.md)
against Lean's actual dependency DAG. Catch three classes of drift:

</summary>

- **Proved capstones that depend on `sorry`** (status should be
  🚧, not ✅).
- **Theorems claimed as capstones that no one actually uses**
  (deletion or downgrade candidates).
- **Proved theorems reachable from multiple capstones that are
  missing from the blueprint** (missing capstones).

**Available tooling** (surveyed 2026-04-21):

| Tool | Repo | Toolchain | Fit |
| ---- | ---- | --------- | --- |
| `theoremgraph` | [`L4YAML.FGM`](../../L4YAML.FGM) (sibling checkout) | Lean 4.30.0-rc1 — matches L4YAML (4.30.0-rc2) closely | **Best fit now.** Already works. Supports `--list`, `--dot`, `--chain`, `--coverage`. Consumes `@[key_theorem "desc"]` attribute (from FGM). |
| `importGraph` | [`leanprover-community/import-graph`](https://github.com/leanprover-community/import-graph), pinned v4.29.0 in L4YAML's lakefile | Already imported | Module-level only; doesn't give theorem-level DAG directly but has the Lean APIs we'd need. |
| `DocVerificationBridge` | `doc-verification-bridge.ghe/DocVerificationBridge` | Lean ≤ 4.29.0 | **Not directly usable yet** — toolchain mismatch (L4YAML is on 4.30.0-rc2). Worth adopting later for the Four-Category Ontology classification. See Phase E. |
| `FGM.KeyTheorem` | [`FGM`](../../FGM) (sibling checkout) | Matches `L4YAML.FGM` | Source of the `@[key_theorem]` attribute. |
| Ad-hoc Lean script using `ConstantInfo.getUsedConstants` | — | any | Fallback if the above fall over. |

**Current coverage**:
[`L4YAML.FGM/KeyTheoremAnnotations.lean`](../../L4YAML.FGM/KeyTheoremAnnotations.lean)
tags only **6 theorems** with `@[key_theorem]`. The blueprint
lists ~45 capstones across 8 groups. The 39-theorem gap is the
immediate tagging backlog.

#### **Phase A — Tag all capstones (risk: low)**

<details>
<summary>

Extend
[`KeyTheoremAnnotations.lean`](../../L4YAML.FGM/KeyTheoremAnnotations.lean)
with one `attribute [key_theorem "..."] ...` line per ✅ capstone
in [`04-capstones.md`](04-capstones.md). Groups 1–8.

</summary>

- **Acceptance**: `lake build -p L4YAML.FGM` passes;
  `lake exe theoremgraph --list` outputs ≥ 45 theorem names
  (matches the blueprint count for ✅ rows).
- **Status source-of-truth**: the attribute text is authoritative
  for the theorem's public description; the blueprint mirrors it.

</details>

#### **Phase B — Diff tool (risk: low)**

<details>
<summary>

`lake exe check-capstones` (in
[`L4YAML.FGM/tools/CheckCapstones.lean`](../../L4YAML.FGM/tools/CheckCapstones.lean))

</summary>

Written in Lean rather than Python so the catalogue is consumed
as typed data (`KeyTheoremCatalogue.entries : Array (Name × KeyAnnotation)`)
instead of by scraping the `theoremgraph --list` output.

1. Loads the authoritative `@[key_theorem]` set from
   `KeyTheoremCatalogue.entries` — the single source of truth;
   source-level elaboration also populates the env extension so
   `#key_theorems` and all downstream widgets see the same set.
2. Parses [`04-capstones.md`](04-capstones.md) for rows of the form
   `| # | `\`theorem_name\`` | module | status |`. Supports
   `foo_*` suffix wildcards inside backticks for bundle-representative
   rows.
3. Prints the **set difference** in both directions:
   - **Missing**: ✅ blueprint rows whose backtick names have no
     matching catalogue entry.
   - **Extra**: catalogue entries not named by any blueprint row.
4. Exits non-zero on drift (1) or CLI/file errors (2).

Flags:
- `--blueprint <path>` — override default path
  (`../lean4-yaml-verified/Blueprint/04-capstones.md`).
- `--include-partial` — also require annotations for 🚧 / 🧩 rows
  (default: ✅ only).
- `--show-ambiguous` — list rows with no parseable backtick
  identifier (informational).

**Integration**: run in CI (L4YAML.FGM `.github/workflows/`); link
from [`06-discipline.md`](06-discipline.md) Rule 4.

**Acceptance**: PR adding a theorem either updates the blueprint
and `KeyTheoremCatalogue.entries`, or fails CI.

</details>

#### **Phase C — Narrative & tiering (risk: low-medium)**

<details>
<summary>

Turn the flat capstone list into a top-down story with 5–8
headline results and a hierarchical index. Runs **before** the
sorry audit (Phase D) because tiering prunes and reorganises the
capstone set — auditing first would waste effort on entries that
later get demoted.

</summary>

Phase B's diff gate enforces *internal* consistency between the
blueprint and the catalogue. Phase C is about *external*
comprehensibility: someone encountering L4YAML for the first time
shouldn't have to read 50+ rows of `04-capstones.md` to learn what
L4YAML actually proves. They should see a handful of headline
results, each with a plain-English summary and a link to its
supporting theorems.

**The problem we're solving**:

- `04-capstones.md` is organized by **topic** (scanner, parser,
  end-to-end, ...) — useful as a reference, useless as an
  introduction.
- `tmp/graphs/index.html` currently lists all ~400 bipartite
  + chain graphs in arbitrary order, making it practically unusable.
- `theorem-graphs.tar.gz` (published by L4YAML.FGM CI and consumed
  by L4YAML's doc build) contains ~840 SVGs when what the docs
  actually need is a small headline subset — everything else is
  reference material that should live behind a "show all" link, not
  eagerly embedded.
- There is no single pointer that answers "what are the public
  guarantees?" — the answer is spread across Group 4, Group 6,
  Group 7, and parts of Group 3.

**1. Tier enum in `FGM.KeyAnnotation`**

Extend `FGM/FGM/KeyTheorem.lean`'s `KeyAnnotation` with an optional
`tier : Option Tier` field:

```lean
inductive Tier
  | headline       -- front-page narrative capstone (5-8 total)
  | groupCapstone  -- leads its group's story
  | support        -- in catalogue but not front page
  | bundleRep      -- representative of a theorem family
  deriving DecidableEq, Hashable
```

Exposed via the attribute syntax:
`@[key_theorem "tier=headline" "..."]` or a dedicated attr arg.

**2. Headline slate** (to be curated, subject to review)

Proposed starting slate for a formal-methods audience:

| Headline | Why experts expect it | Plain-English summary |
|---|---|---|
| 3.11 `parseStream_respects_grammar_unconditional` | spec conformance | "parser output matches the written YAML 1.2.2 grammar" |
| 4.1 `parse_sound` | soundness | "if we accept, the result is well-formed" |
| 4.3 `parse_complete` | completeness | "every well-formed YAML is accepted" |
| 4.7 `parse_deterministic` | functionality | "the parser is a function, not a relation" |
| 5.5 `validYaml_construct` | value-level soundness | "every successful parse yields a `ValidYaml`" |
| 6.9 `universal_roundtrip` (or 6.10 aspirational) | round-trip | "emit then parse gives back the same content" |
| 7.6 `parse_strict_proof` | strictness | "we never accept ill-formed input" |

Each headline gets:
- A 1-sentence plain-English summary (non-expert-readable).
- The formal statement in full.
- A 1-paragraph "what this means in practice" block.
- A pointer to supporting theorems (for the expert reader).

Headlines that are 🚧/🧩 are allowed on the front page *iff* the
open conditions or remaining sorry sites are clearly stated in the
plain-English summary. Headlines that regress drop off the front
page until they recover.

**3. Tier-filtered graph generation + hierarchical `index.html`**

Extend `theoremgraph` with a `--tier <name>` filter that writes
only graphs for entries matching the given tier (comma-separated
names accepted). Current behavior (no filter) stays the full catalogue.

Rewrite `generateIndexHtml` to render:

1. **Front page**: each headline's chain graph inline, plus its
   plain-English summary.
2. **Group pages**: one sub-page per blueprint group, listing its
   group-capstone and supports.
3. **Full catalogue**: flat link to everything (today's behavior).

Numbers-wise: `theoremgraph --tier headline` emits ~6 chain SVGs;
`--tier headline,groupCapstone` emits ~25–50; the full run stays
at ~840. The 10×–100× size reduction is the difference between
"L4YAML doc page loads in seconds" and "doc page times out."

**4. L4YAML.FGM release artifact split**

The L4YAML.FGM CI workflow currently publishes a single
`theorem-graphs.tar.gz` containing every SVG. Update it to publish
two artifacts per release:

- `theorem-graphs-headlines.tar.gz` — `--tier headline,groupCapstone`
  output. Small (~50 SVGs + the hierarchical index), always embedded
  by L4YAML's doc build.
- `theorem-graphs-all.tar.gz` — the full catalogue (today's tarball
  content). Downloaded on demand from the release page; not embedded.

L4YAML's doc build (in the L4YAML repo, not L4YAML.FGM) pulls only
the headlines tarball by default. A visitor who wants the full
catalogue follows a link on the narrative page to the GitHub
release asset. This keeps the default doc build fast and keeps the
exhaustive material one click away.

**5. Narrative file**

New `Blueprint/01-what-we-prove.md` (sits before `02-architecture.md`
in the reading order). Walks the headlines top-down, links each
to its row in `04-capstones.md` for the formal statement and to
the corresponding chain graph (served from the
`theorem-graphs-headlines.tar.gz` artifact L4YAML's doc build has
already unpacked). Written to be readable by a YAML user who is not
a formal-methods expert, but precise enough for the expert to follow
the links through.

**6. `check-capstones` extension**

Add `--require-headlines-proven` mode: fail CI if any headline
entry has status 🚧 (partial) or 🗑 (deletion candidate). Stricter
than the default ✅/🚧-agnostic check.

**Acceptance**:

- Every headline has plain-English, formal, and practical
  descriptions in `01-what-we-prove.md`.
- `theorem-graphs-headlines.tar.gz` is under a small size budget
  (say 2 MB uncompressed, vs. today's ~30 MB) and contains only the
  headline + group-capstone SVGs plus the hierarchical index.
- L4YAML's doc build embeds the headlines tarball by default; the
  full catalogue is a one-click download from the release page.
- A reader new to the project can answer "what does L4YAML
  prove?" after 5 minutes of reading, without opening any `.lean`
  file.

**Risk**: the curation is a judgment call that changes as proofs
mature. Mitigation: headlines are declarative (tagged entries),
not code; they can be re-tiered in a single PR when the proof
state shifts.

</details>

#### **Phase D — Sorry-reachability audit (risk: medium)**

<details>
<summary>

For each capstone in
[`04-capstones.md`](04-capstones.md), use
`lake exe theoremgraph --dot <name>` to extract the dependency
DAG, then check whether any transitive dependency contains
`sorry`. Downgrade status from ✅ to 🚧 for any capstone that does.

</summary>

Runs after Phase C so the audit targets the tiered set (headlines
and group capstones first, supports last) — not a flat list that
Phase C would then reshuffle.

- **Tooling choices**:
  - Simplest: run `theoremgraph --dot` per capstone, grep each
    output for dependency names that also show up in
    [`05-current-state.md`](05-current-state.md)'s sorry table.
  - Better: extend `theoremgraph` with a `--reaches-sorry` mode
    that classifies capstones as "kernel-checked" vs
    "transitively-conditional-on-sorry".
- **Acceptance**: the ✅ rows in [`04-capstones.md`](04-capstones.md)
  are the minimal set whose proofs are kernel-checked without
  `sorry` in any dependency. This catches the silent drift where
  a capstone's proof is green but a helper it depends on has
  regressed to `sorry`.

</details>

#### **Phase E — DocVerificationBridge integration (risk: high, defer)**

<details>
<summary>

Adopt DocVerificationBridge's Four-Category Ontology once the
toolchain mismatch is resolved. Two routes:

</summary>

- Wait for DocVerificationBridge to support 4.30.0+ (watch
  [`Experiments/ExperimentsCore.lean:maxSupportedVersion`](../../doc-verification-bridge.ghe/Experiments/Experiments/ExperimentsCore.lean)).
- Or: temporarily branch L4YAML to 4.29.0 for one analysis run,
  record the classification output as a baseline, then rebase
  forward. Only worth doing if the ontology gives us something
  `theoremgraph` doesn't.

The Four-Category value proposition for L4YAML: cleanly separates
**spec-side** (Grammar, Surface, Production — "mathematical
abstractions") from **impl-side** (Scanner, Parser, Emitter —
"computational operations") with **coupling theorems** as the
ontological glue. That mirrors the trust-boundary structure in
[`02-architecture.md`](02-architecture.md). So integration is
valuable long-term, but not blocking.

**Overall exit criterion for Initiative 2**: a CI job runs on
every PR, asserts that every ✅ capstone in the blueprint has
(a) a matching `@[key_theorem]` attribute, (b) a kernel-checked
proof with no `sorry` in its transitive dependency tree, and
(c) a dependency graph that's a subset of other capstones +
acknowledged infrastructure. A failing job points at which of
the three checks broke.

### Sequencing

Initiative 2 Phase A (tag all capstones) should go **first** —
it's low-risk, it unlocks the diff tool (Phase B) that catches
drift during Initiative 1's moves, and it validates the
[`04-capstones.md`](04-capstones.md) inventory while the blueprint
is still fresh in memory. Initiative 1 Phase 1 (folder moves) can
run in parallel once Phase A is in place, since the capstone
names don't change during folder moves.

Concrete 1-week target:

1. Day 1–2: Initiative 2 Phase A (tag the remaining ~39
   capstones). **Done 2026-04-22.**
2. Day 2: Initiative 2 Phase B (`lake exe check-capstones`, wire
   into CI). **Done 2026-04-23.**
3. Day 3: Run Phase B against current state; reconcile any
   mismatch between blueprint and attributes. **Done 2026-04-23
   (11 drift items resolved; catalogue pruned from 64 → 56
   entries).**
4. Day 4–5: Initiative 2 Phase C (narrative & tiering) — curate
   the headline slate, add the `Tier` enum, emit split tarballs,
   write `01-what-we-prove.md`. Ordered before Phase D because the
   tiering pass re-scopes the capstone set a sorry audit would
   otherwise waste effort on.
5. Day 6: Initiative 2 Phase D (sorry-reachability audit); update
   ✅/🚧 statuses in [`04-capstones.md`](04-capstones.md) against
   the tiered set.
6. Day 7: Start Initiative 1 Phase 1.
7. Following weeks: Initiative 1 Phases 2, 3, 4 as separate PRs.

Initiative 2 Phase E (DocVerificationBridge) is deferred — revisit
once DVB supports 4.30.0 or after A–D land and the rest of the
blueprint is stable.
